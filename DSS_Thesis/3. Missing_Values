#Missing Values

There are several columns with null values:
default_choice [1,201,814 missing] - Default choice is dependent of the different scenario types. For instance, Gender has the default choice of Male. The default choice will be used/dropped from further processing.
nondefault_choice [1,201,814 missing] Non-default choice is dependent of the different scenario types. For instance, Gender has the non-default choice of Female. The default choice will be used/dropped from further processing.
default_choice_is_omission [1,201,814 missing] - With omission it is refered to an intervention of 0, while the default choice is already given in the default_choice column. However when omission is 1, the characters associated with the default choice will be faced the deathful option in the dilemma. Meaning: they will be killed when the car does not intervene. So 0 means no intervention in the dilemma of the car and 1 means there is intervention.
template [398 missing] - The template refers to the template used during the survey. Which is not relevant for further processing.
description_shown [398 missing] - The description shown refers to the description of the dilemma. Which is not relevant for further processing.
left_hand [398 missing] - Refers to the hand used while filling in the survey. For the scope of the research this will be dropped since it does not carry any relevance.
user_country3 [41,641 missing] - The ISO-3 codes of countries are given, based on the country from which the participant filled in the survey.
review_age [1,360,030 missing] - Review age shows the age in a rounded number for instance: 16.0. In other research this variable was some times used and some times not. As a comprise, we can use this variable as a binned categorical feature instead
